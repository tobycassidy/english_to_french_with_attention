# english_to_french_with_attention

This repo intends to walkthrough a use case for sequence to sequence with attention, specifically for translating English to French. Using attention with this use case can be of a real benefit as the context/meaning of the sentence as a whole can be emphasised rather than simply translating a mapping from each english word to each french word.
